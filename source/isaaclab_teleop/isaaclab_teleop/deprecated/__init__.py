"""Deprecated teleoperation classes consolidated under isaaclab_teleop.

This sub-package contains legacy OpenXR device classes, retargeters, and the
teleop device factory that were previously located in
:mod:`isaaclab.devices.openxr` and :mod:`isaaclab.devices`.  They are preserved
here for backward compatibility while users migrate to the new
:class:`~isaaclab_teleop.IsaacTeleopDevice` API.
